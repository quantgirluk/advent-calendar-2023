# Day 16 : Von Mises

The [von](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Mises) **[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Mises)**[Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Mises) distribution, named after Austrian scientist Richard von Moses, is a unimodal probability distribution on the circle. It is also known as the circular normal distribution or [Tikhonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Nikolayevich_Tikhonov) distribution. It is a close approximation to the [wrapped normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapped_normal_distribution), which is the circular analogue of the [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). It is defined by a location parameter $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$, and a concentration measure $\kappa >0$. The concentration parameter is the reciprocal of dispersion.

The probability density function is given by

$$f(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa \cos (x-\mu)}}{ 2 \pi I_0(\kappa)},$$

where $I_0(\kappa)$ is the modified [Bessel function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function#Bessel_functions_of_the_first_kind:_J%CE%B1) of the first kind of order 0, with this scaling constant chosen so that the distribution sums to unity:  $\int _{-\pi }^{\pi }\exp(\kappa \cos x)dx={2\pi I_{0}(\kappa )}$.

The cumulative distribution function is not analytical.

## ðŸ”” Random Facts ðŸ””

- When $\kappa$ is large, the distribution resembles a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). More precisely, as $\kappa$ goes to infinity, the it converges to a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ where $\sigma^2 = 1/\kappa$.

- When $\kappa$ tends to zero, the probability density function resembles the density of a [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_\(continuous\)) defined on the chosen interval of length $2\pi$.

- The von Mises distribution is a special case of the [von Misesâ€“Fisher distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises%E2%80%93Fisher_distribution) on the _N_-dimensional sphere.

- It can be obtained as the hitting density of a two-dimensional Brownian motion starting at the origin, with constant drift velocity and direction. This was shown in ["A Characterization of the Von Mises Distribution."](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-5/issue-4/A-Characterization-of-the-Von-Mises-Distribution/10.1214/aos/1176343906.full) (Ann. Statist. 5 (4) 813 - 814, July, 1977)

- The von Mises distribution is commonly used in the statistical analysis of directions which in turn has many uses in areas such as meteorology, earth sciences, physics, and biology.
