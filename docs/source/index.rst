Advent Calendar of Distributions
================================

In 2023, I used the countdown to Christmas 🎄 to explore the re-visit the world of `probability distributions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution>`_.
Each day, we unwrapped a different distribution --exploring its shape, story, and where it appears in the real world.


From the familiar bell curve of the normal distribution to the quirky surprises of the Poisson or Cauchy,
these mathematical gems help us make sense of randomness, uncertainty, and data.

Whether you're a statistics enthusiast, a data scientist, or just curious about the patterns behind chance,
this calendar will guide you through the rich tapestry of distributions that underpin science, finance, technology, and more.
So, get cozy, open today’s door, and let’s discover the hidden beauty of probability—one distribution at a time!
