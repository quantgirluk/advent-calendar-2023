# Day 13 : Exponential

The exponential distribution or negative exponential distribution is the probability distribution of the time between events in a [Poisson point process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process), i.e., a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It has support $[0, \infty)$ and is defined by a parameter $\lambda>0$ which is called rate (or inverse scale).

The probability density function is given by

$$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \qquad x\geq 0.$$

The cumulative distribution function is given by

$$F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}, \qquad x\geq 0.$$

- An exponentially distributed random variable $T\sim Exp(\lambda)$ obeys the relation $P(T>s+t| T>s) = P(T>t)$. This property is known as memorylessness.

- The exponential distribution and the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution) are [the only memoryless probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorylessness). The exponential distribution is consequently also necessarily the only continuous probability distribution that has a constant [failure rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate).

- If _X_ ~ [Pareto(1, Î»)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution), then log(_X_) ~ Exp(Î»).

- In physics it is often used to measure [radioactive decay](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/radioactive-decay), in engineering it is used to measure the time associated with receiving a defective part on an assembly line, and in finance it is often used to measure the likelihood of the next default for a portfolio of financial assets. It can also be used to measure the likelihood of incurring a specified number of defaults within a specified time period.
