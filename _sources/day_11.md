# Day 11 : F

The _F_-distribution is also known as  _F_-ratio, Snedecor's _F_ distribution, or the Fisherâ€“Snedecor distribution after British polymath [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) and American mathematician [George W. Snedecor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Snedecor). It is a continuous probability distribution with support on $[0, \infty)$, defined by two parameters $d_1, d_2 >0$ which are called degrees of freedom. More precisely, the $F$ distribution with $d_1$ and $d_2$, degrees of freedom is the distribution given by $X = \frac{S_1/ d_1}{ S_2/d_2}$ where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are independent random variables with [chi-square distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution) with respective degrees of freedom $d_1$ and $d_2$.

The probability density function is given by

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{x B\left(\frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2} \right)} \sqrt{ \frac{ (d_1x)^{d1} d_2^{d2} }{ (d_1x + d_2)^{d_1 + d_2} } }$$

where $B$ is the [beta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function).

The cumulative distribution function is given by

$$F(x) = I_{d_1x/(d_1x + d_2)}\left( \frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2} \right)$$

where $I$ is the [regularized incomplete beta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularized_incomplete_beta_function).

- It arises frequently as the [null distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_distribution) of a [test statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_statistic), most notably in the [analysis of variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) (ANOVA)

- If $X \sim F(d_1, d_2)$, then $X^{-1} \sim F(d_2, d_1)$.

- Its moment generating function does not exist

- There is no analytical expression for the characteristic function of the F distribution. But it can be written in terms of the [confluent hypergeometric function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluent_hypergeometric_function) of the second kind. This was shown by British econometrician P.C.B Phillips in his paper [The True Characteristic Function of the F Distribution (1982, Biometrika)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2335882)
