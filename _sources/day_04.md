# Day 4 : Pareto

The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian polymath [Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto), is a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) that is used to describe many types of observable phenomena (e.g. in social and actuarial sciences, quality control, and economics ); the principle originally applied to describing the [distribution of wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth) in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population. The Pareto distribution is defined by a a shape parameter (also called a slope parameter or Pareto index) $\alpha>0$, and a scale parameter $x_m>0$.

The probability density function is given by

$$f(x) = \frac{\alpha x_m^{\alpha}}{x^{\alpha + 1}} 1_{[x_m, \infty)}(x).$$

The cumulative distribution function is given by

$$F(x) = \left[ 1 - \left(\frac{ x_m}{x}\right)^{\alpha} \right] 1_{[x_m, \infty)}(x).$$

## ðŸ”” Random Facts ðŸ””

- Let $X$ be a random variable which follows a Pareto distribution $X\sim Pareto(x_m, \alpha)$, and $x_1> x_m$. The conditional distribution of $X$ given $X\geq x_1$, is also Pareto with the same Pareto index $\alpha$ and scale parameter $x_1$. This property means that the Pareto distribution is closed with respect to conditioning on a right-tail event.

- The moment generating function of the Pareto distribution does not exist.
