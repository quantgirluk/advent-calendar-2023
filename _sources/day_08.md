# Day 8 : Hypergeometric

The hypergeometric distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of $k$ successes (random draws for which the object drawn has a specified feature) in $n$ draws, without replacement, from a finite [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population) of size $N$  that contains exactly $K$ objects with that feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure.

The probability mass function is given by

$$f(k) =\frac{ {K \choose k}{ N-K \choose n-k} }{ N \choose n }.$$

The cumulative distribution function is given by

$$F(k) = \frac{ {n \choose k+1}{ N-n \choose K-k-1} }{ N \choose K } {_3}{F}{_2}(1, k+1-K, k+1-n; k+2, N+k+2-K-n; 1),$$

where ${_2}F_{_1}$ is the generalised hypergeometric function.

- Similarly to the Binomial distribution, it describes the probability of successes in a given number of draws. The difference is that there is no replacement after each draw.

- Quality control in manufacturing is a common application of the Hypergeometric Distribution. It is used by engineers and quality experts to test a sample of products from an assembly line to identify defective items.

- The name Hypergeometric is relatively recent but the distribution first appears as the solution to Problem IV of Huygens's [_De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae_](http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/huygens.pdf) (1657, p. 12) (_"The Value of all Chances in Games of Fortune"_). Several people, besides [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens), solved the problem and James Bernoulli and de Moivre gave solutions for the general case. See Hald (1990, pp. 201-2). At the end of the 19th century Karl Pearson wrote a paper in which he considered fitting the distribution (given by the "hypergeometrical series") to data: "On Certain Properties of the Hypergeometrical Series, and on the Fitting of such Series to Observation Polygons in the Theory of Chance" _Philosophical Magazine_, 47, (1899), 236-246.
